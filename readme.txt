    "description": "Soak up the power of the Sun with science and engineering projects that explore all things solar, including the solar system, solar power and sustainable energy, solar options for cleaning water, the greenhouse effect, and more.\r\n\r\nAs the biggest star and largest object in our solar system, there are many astronomy projects students can explore related to the Sun, but there are lots of other sun and solar angles students can investigate with independent science projects. Even the Northern Lights are caused by the Sun! From alternative and renewable energy to the \"heat\" of the Sun, the dangers of ultraviolet (UV) rays, and the effectiveness of sunscreens, there are a range of Sun-centered projects and experiments students can do.",
